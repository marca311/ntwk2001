This program runs the sum_test script in the background.
The sum_test script keeps an eye on the files specified in filelist.txt
Any difference in the files will be reported to the specified email adress and then replaced
with a backup of what the file was like during installation.
The backup files are stored in a location specified during installation and encrypted with a passcode.
Any modification to the backups will be reported to the email address.
All files are checked using a sha512 checksum.

filelist.txt can be modified before installation to include files to back up.
However the list of files being monitored can not be changed after installation.
Run the project_setup script as root with the install argument:
project_setup install

The script will be started by the install process and will be started on boot.
However the process can be started and stopped manually through systemctl:
systemctl start bash_file_monitor.service
systemctl stop bash_file_monitor.service
systemctl enable bash_file_monitor.service
systemctl disable bash_file_monitor.service
